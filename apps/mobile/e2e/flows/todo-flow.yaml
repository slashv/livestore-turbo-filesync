# Gallery Flow (formerly Todo Flow)
# This file is kept for backwards compatibility
# Tests: login, verify gallery loads

# Clear keychain (where expo-secure-store keeps auth tokens)
- clearKeychain

# Clear app state and stop the app
- launchApp:
    clearState: true
    stopApp: true

# Register a unique user for this test run to ensure clean state
- runScript: ../scripts/register-user.js

# Launch app fresh after registration
- launchApp

# Step 1: Login with the unique test user
- assertVisible: "Sign In"
- tapOn:
    id: "email-input"
- inputText: ${output.testUser.email}
- tapOn:
    id: "password-input"
- inputText: ${output.testUser.password}
- tapOn:
    id: "login-button"

# Dismiss iOS "Save Password" dialog if it appears
- runFlow:
    when:
      visible:
        text: ".*assword.*"
    commands:
      - tapOn:
          text: ".*ot Now.*"

# Step 2: Wait for gallery to load (app now shows gallery instead of todos)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible:
      id: "gallery"
    timeout: 15000

# Step 3: Verify gallery elements are present
- assertVisible:
    id: "upload-button"

# Step 4: Verify empty state shows (no images yet)
- assertVisible:
    id: "empty-state"
